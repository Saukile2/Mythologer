            Collier</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Lilith is a demonic figure. She is first mentioned in Biblical Hebrew
            in Isaiah 34:14, and later in Late Antiquity in Mandaean Gnosticism mythology and Jewish mythology
            sources from 500 AD onwards. Lilith
            appears in historiolas (incantations incorporating a short mythic story) in various concepts and
            localities that give partial descriptions of her. She is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (Eruvin
            100b, Niddah 24b, Shabbat 151b, Baba Bathra
            73a), in The Book of Adam and Eve as Adam's first wife, and in the Zohar Leviticus 19a as "a hot fiery
            female who first cohabited with man".<br> Lilith perhaps originated from an earlier class of female
            demons (lilû, lilîtu, and (w)ardat
            lilî) in the ancient Mesopotamian religion, found in cuneiform texts of Sumer, Assyria, and Babylonia.
            Lilith continues to serve as source material in modern Western culture, literature, occultism, fantasy,
            and horror.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>History Of Lilith</h3><br> In some Jewish folklore, such as the satiric Alphabet of Sirach (c. AD
            700–1000), Lilith appears as Adam's first wife, who was created at the same time (Rosh Hashanah) and
            from the same clay as Adam – compare
            Genesis 1:27 ( this contrasts with Eve, who was created from one of Adam's ribs: Genesis 2:22). The
            legend of Lilith developed extensively during the Middle Ages, in the tradition of Aggadah, the Zohar,
            and Jewish mysticism. For example,
            in the 11th-century writings of Isaac ben Jacob ha-Cohen, Lilith left Adam after she refused to become
            subservient to him and then would not return to the Garden of Eden after she had coupled with the
            archangel Samael <i><a class="w3-blue" href="Navigation/Mythologer_default.html">....read more..../</a></i>
