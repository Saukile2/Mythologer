        <h2 class="w3-white">The Leg Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>After a morning walk a group of Doctors were standing on a road crossing and enjoying a cup of tea, when they
            saw a man limping towards them.
            One Doctor said he has Left Knee Arthritis
            The second said he is Plantar Facitis'.
            The third said, just an Ankle Sprain.
            The fourth said, see that man cannot lift his knee, he looks like he has Lower Motor Neuron lesion
            But to me he seems to have Hemiplegia Scissors Gait, said the fifth.
            But before the sixth could proclaim his diagnosis... The man reached the group and asked "is there any
            *Cobbler* nearby who can repair my Slippers " please?
            *_That is exactly how people express opinions on your issue. So, don't bother about their opinions; face
            your God, be focused and fervent in your prayers and He will answer you soon._*
            *Lesson for all

        <h2 class="w3-white">The Deafness of Men</h2>
        <p> Max and his wife Lola received a letter from their daughter who had gone to study "Modern Biochemistry"
            overseas.
            She wrote, "My beloved parents, I miss you so much and it breaks my heart to think that by the time I get
            back, you will be so old. Therefore, I am enclosing a bottle of a red potion that I have invented. It will
            make you 5 years younger, and so when I return, you will be the same age as I left you. *Please, take only a
            drop.* Goodbye I love you!"
            They opened the envelope and found the bottle with the red potion.
            Max looked at his wife and said, "You go first."
            Lola took a drop and when she indeed turned 5 years younger, Max embraced his turn.
            Years later, the daughter returns home to find her mother... she is younger and happier, and she is carrying
            a baby on her back. She tells her daughter how the potion worked and how it has made her look younger. The
            daughter is happy and she asks about her father.
            "Your father? Hmmm! You know how men don't listen! He drank the whole bottle."
            "Whaaat! Where is he?"
            "Who do you think is on my back?"

        <h2 class="w3-white">The Problem Crusher</h2>
        <p>A Man had 3 problems: <br>
            1: He was very poor. <br>
            2: He has no children with his wife. <br>
            3: His Mother is blind. <br>
            An Angel appeared to him and tells him he can only make one prayer request, only one! But his wife wants a
            child, his mother wants to see and he wants to be rich ... <br>
            Ah, what embarrassment!
            After his reflection, he said wisely to the angel:
            "I just want my mother to see my children eating in gold plates."
            Immediately all problems were solved. <br>

        <h2 class="w3-white">The Juice Insufficiency</h2>
        <p>After I had cleaned and tidied up my house, my brother phoned me and said, "My wife and I are coming to visit
            you."
            I went to my kitchen to prepare something for them, but I could not find anything available to serve them.
            After much thought and search, all I could lay my hands on were a few oranges. Therefore, I made two cups of
            cold juice immediately.
            When my brother and his wife arrived I was shocked to see his mother-in-law with them, who came to visit us
            for the first time.
            So, I served the two cups of juice to his wife and her mother, and I placed a cup of water in front of my
            brother, saying, 'I know that you like Sprite.'
            He drank a sip and realized that it was water.
            And suddenly his mother-in-law said, I'm feeling for Sprite. Please give it to me!
            Here I was, baffled and caught up with embarrassment.
            But my brother saved me by saying to her, 'I will bring you a clean glass from the kitchen.'
            After a while, we heard the sound of a glass breaking in the kitchen. He then came back and told his
            mother-in-law, 'Sorry, it fell from my hands and the glass broke. But no problem, I will go to the shop to
            get another one.
            His mother-in-law refused and said, "There is no need for that. It was not meant for me anyway."
            Eventually, when they were going, my brother bid me farewell and placed some money into my hand, and said,
            "Don't forget to clean the kitchen of the Sprite so that ants do not come." And he bid me farewell with a
            smile and love.
            In this way, my brother considered my feelings and concealed my shortcoming.
            *THIS IS SIBLING LOVE AND BLOOD RELATIONSHIP.*
            When you're in a position, use it to lift others.
            Running anyone down will never make you better! Let me ask, how do you treat your siblings, friends, family,
            colleagues, etc?
            Do you cover-up their shame or you expose them?

        <h2 class="w3-white">The Connection Theory</h2>
        <p>"I told my son he would marry a girl I choose"... He said NO!

        <h2 class="w3-white">The Virginity Ignorance</h2>
        <p>I entered a shop and bought a pack with 3 condoms, looked at them curiously for a while wondering how on
            earth I could use them. The Lady at the counter noticed my puzzlement and asked sincerely, ''Have you ever
            used a condom? <br>
            Do you know how to put it on?'' I blushed and said,"No!" The lady took one condom and opened it and wore it
            on her thumb as an example. "This is how you wear it. You have to make sure its tight!'' I was even more
            puzzled by this. I was just an innocent young man. She noticed how shy and confused I was. "You must be a
            virgin," she said teasingly. "Have you ever had sex?"... She asked.. l said, ''No!" Then she looked around
            the shop; there was no one but just the 2 of us. She called me behind the counter, opened the door leading
            to the back rooms and invited me in. She quickly locked the door,told me to hurry up... "We don't have
            time!" She said. She pulled her short skirt up, her panty down,opened her
            legs and layed her back on a table. Then she told me to wear the condom on just like she had told me. I did,
            and she pulled me close, and oh yes there I Was right deep inside her wet sweet flesh. ...... But Oh My Cow
            no, in just two minutes inside it was just too much and I came, tsaaa tsaaa tsaaa tsaaaa twii twii tsaaa
            ziii.!! The lady feels it too, she feels the hot fluid inside her,and asks me, ''Did you put the condom on
            like I told you?" "Yes I did. Just like you told me!" I replied. She says, ''Lets see!" (I showed her) "Oh
            shit!" she screamed. "You are supposed to wear it on your PENIS not on your THUMB, you fool...!!!..
            <br> .

        <h2 class="w3-white">The Monkey Business Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>A lot of monkeys lived near a village.
            <br> One day a merchant came to the village to buy these monkeys!
            <br> He announced that he will buy the monkeys @ $100 each.
            <br> The villagers thought that this man is mad.
            <br> They thought how can somebody buy stray monkeys at $100 each?
            <br> Still, some people caught some monkeys and gave it to this merchant and he gave $100 for each monkey.
            <br> This news spread like wildfire and people caught monkeys and sold it to the merchant.
            <br> After a few days, the merchant announced that he will buy monkeys @ 200 each.
            <br> The lazy villagers also ran around to catch the remaining monkeys!
            <br> They sold the remaining monkeys @ 200 each.
            <br> Then the merchant announced that he will buy monkeys @ 500 each!
            <br> The villagers start to lose sleep! ... They caught six or seven monkeys, which was all that was left
            and got 500 each.
            <br> The villagers were waiting anxiously for the next announcement.
            <br> Then the merchant announced that he is going home for a week. And when he returns, he will buy monkeys
            @ 1000 each!
            <br> He asked his employee to take care of the monkeys he bought. He was alone taking care of all the
            monkeys in a
            cage.
            <br> The merchant went home.
            <br> The villagers were very sad as there were no more monkeys left for them to sell it at $1000 each.
            <br> Then the employee told them that he will sell some monkeys @ 700 each secretly. 
            <br> This news spread like fire. Since the merchant buys monkey @ 1000 each, there is a 300 profit for each
            monkey.
            <br> The next day, villagers made a queue near the monkey cage.
            <br> The employee sold all the monkeys at 700 each. The rich bought monkeys in big lots. The poor borrowed
            money from money lenders and also bought monkeys!
            <br> 🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒
            <br> The villagers took care of their monkeys & waited for the merchant to return. 
            <br> But nobody came! ... Then they ran to the employee...
            <br> But he has already left too !
            <br> The villagers then realized that they have bought the useless stray monkeys @ 700 each and unable to
            sell them!.
            <br> This is the story of crypto currency and other similar instruments...
            <br> Watch out for the next monkey business
            <br> It will make a lot of people bankrupt and a few people filthy rich in this monkey business. 
            <br> That' how it works
