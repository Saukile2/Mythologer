        <hr>
        <p>I always hear ladies say "He just used and dumped me, after all I suffered with him, after all I did for him
            ".
            My dear friend, if you didn't give him your kidney, sell your father's land or give him a loan to start a
            business, you did nothing.
            That you drank garri with him is because you're also broke. If not, you would have prepared a decent meal.
            That you stayed in the gutters or under the bridge with him is not a sacrifice, because if you had a palace,
            you wouldn't have done that.
            About using you, my dear, if it was a mutual agreement between both of you, then you shouldn't say he used
            you. You both had fun and used yourselves.
            The only reason you feel hurt and left out is because you abandoned yourself in his shadow. You lost
            yourself in him. While he is staying out at night thinking outside the box, while he's setting goals and
            achieving them, you were busy counting the days, waiting for him to blow or hammer. While he was investing
            in his future, you left yours stagnant without any meaningful long term plans. A young guy is struggling to
            survive, struggling to make it, but you will come in the name of girlfriend to ask him money for hair,
            shoes, cream, soap, pad, undies, thereby spending what he's supposed to be saving or investing, and in the
            end, you begin to wail on how he used and dumped you after suffering with him.
            My dearest sisters, my point is, stop supporting him in bed. Start supporting his dreams, ideas, and vision.
            As he's struggling to establish himself, strive to make yourself relevant, add values to yourself, make your
            own money, too. Don't depend totally on him.
            If you don't contribute anything tangible either in cash, assistance, anything that's progressive or crucial
            towards his success, don't play victim if he gets tired of the relationship.
            Times have changed. Men are no longer the only ones winning bread, women are now bread winners, too.
            Sex is not enough!
            Love is not enough!
            Have a purpose!
        </p> <br>
        <h2 class="w3-white">☆SALT☆</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Salt has no need to look like other ingredients, sends out no aroma like other seasonings, but without it the
            soup is tasteless.
            Men of true impact don't fight for position, visibility or appearance.
            Their results speak for them not their propaganda.
            You don't need to shout to be heard, people keep quiet to listen to intelligent people,
            Salt maintains its integrity amidst pollution.
            Have you seen where a salt buyer demands to taste it before buying? because salt has proved its integrity
            over the ages.
            If you will need to swear before people believe you, you lack integrity. <br>
            Is your life salt to the earth or an insult?
            The easiest and only way the salt can lose its taste is when mixed up.
            Watch your association, you are too precious to be wasted..
            Be salt not an insult. <br>
            BE & STAY INSPIRED.

        <h2 class="w3-white">☆TOMATOES☆</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>🍅A teacher asked her students to bring some tomatoes in a plastic bag to school.
            <br> 🍅Each tomato was to be given the name of a person whom that child hates.
            <br> 🍅So, the number of tomatoes would be equal to the number of persons they hate.
            <br> 🍅On a pre-determined day, All the children brought their tomatoes well addressed.
            <br> 🍅Some had two, some had three and some had five, some even had 20 tomatoes in accordance with the
            number of people they hated.
            <br> 🍅The teacher then told them they had to carry the tomatoes with them everywhere they go for two weeks.
            <br> 🍅As the days passed the children started to complain about the decay and smell of the tomatoes.
            <br> 🍅The students who had many tomatoes complained it was very heavy to carry and the smell was too much.
            <br> 🍅After a week, the teacher asked the students “How did you feel this week?”
            <br> 🍅The children complained of the awful smell and heavy weight of the tomatoes, especially those who
            carried several tomatoes.
            <br> 🍅The teacher said, “This is very similar to what you carry in your heart when you don’t like some
            people.
            <br> 🍅Hatred makes the heart unhealthy and you carry that hatred everywhere.
            <br> 🍅If you can’t bear the smell of spoilt tomatoes for a week, imagine the impact of bitterness on your
            heart as you carry it daily.”
            <br> 🍅The heart is a beautiful garden that needs regular cleaning of unwanted weeds.
            <br> 🍅 Forgive those who have angered you.
            <br> 🍅This makes room for storing good things.
            <br> 🍅Get Better, Not Bitter!!!

        <h2 class="w3-white">☆WALK IN PATIENCE☆</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>A 40-year-old man visited his old father who could no longer see very well.
            As both of them sat in front of his house chatting, a dove flew in and perched on the window.
            The old man asked his son, "Is that a dove that perched on the window?". The son replied, "Yes dad".
            After a short while, he asked the son the same question a second time and got the same answer.
            When he asked the same question the third time, his son became angry and rebuked him saying, *"This is why I
            hate visiting you, you keep repeating questions!" <br>
            The old man was silent for about 10 minutes, and then *he asked the son to go into his bedroom and fetch his
            old diary.* The son did as he requested. Then he asked him to read page 2 of the diary. The words read:
            "My son is 3 years old today. As we sat in front of the house playing, a dove flew in and perched on the
            window. My son asked me 30 times if it was a dove. I gladly replied "yes" to each question. I cannot explain
            in words how happy I am that my son has learned to talk. What a wonderful day to remember!" <br>
            The young man dropped the diary on the ground, then he cried and apologized to his father. The old man
            spoke again, "Enough son, one mistake cannot make you less a man, but repeating the same mistake over and
            over again can kill any man.* I've chosen today to teach you the final lesson before I depart this world.
            The lesson for today is Patience. Always be kind and considerate to the less privileged, this is how you'll
            stand out in eternity*. *Be nice to everyone on your way up, you'll definitely meet them again on your way
            down!" <br>
            The person you looked down today may turn out to be the person you need tomorrow. Lets learn to walk in
            patience and tolerate each other even in adverse conditions.
        </p> <br>
        <h2 class="w3-white">☆RAVEN STUPIDITY☆</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The only bird that dares to peck an eagle is the raven. It sits on the eagle's back and bites its neck.
            <br> However, the eagle doesn't respond or fight with the raven. It does not spend time or energy with the
            raven.
            <br> It just opens its wings and begins to fly higher in the sky. The higher the flight, the harder it is
            for the raven to breathe and the raven eventually falls due to lack of oxygen.
            <br> Not all battles you need to respond to. Not all arguments or critics you need to respond to or answer
            back. Just lift up a standard, they'll fall off!
            <br> Stop wasting time with the 'ravens'.
            <br> Just take them to your height and they'll fade away.
            <br> The enemy may sit on your back and bite your neck..
            <br> But remember, "The race is not for the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor the bread to the wise,
            nor riches to men of skill, but time and chances happen to them all"
            <br> May The Lord take you to a height where it'll be difficult for the enemies to peck on you in Jesus
            name! Amen
