        <h2 class="w3-white">WHY SHOULD LADIES AVOID SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>If you have sex with a man, his DNA lives in you forever.
            A research by university of Seattle USA has proven that.
            There is now a greater understanding of why God asks us not to have sex before we get married.
            This research proves that any man, that a woman has sex with leaves a part of his DNA in the woman.
            The man who has had more sex with her, leaves more of his DNA in the woman. So when a woman ovulates, the
            eggs that she produces contain more of other DNAs.
            So we need to educate the girlchild to remain a virgin till marriage.
            Anytime you have sex with another man you become one with that man (spiritually too) and carry the man's
            DNA.
            At some point when you have too many of the male DNA in you; you change, because your cells are changing.
            That also proves why when married couples live together for a long time they end up looking alike. The
            woman's DNA changes when she has sex with men. This is very serious.
            The world should know this and stop silly sex promotions.
            It is bad than good.
            Unfortunately women are the victims.
            This was found out in many other research articles mostly released this year. So it is new and we all have
            to know.
            The fact is, women retain DNA from every man they have slept with.
            Cells transferred from a man to a woman during intercourse become integrated into the woman's body after
            sex, every single time they have sex.
            This study found the presence of genetically distinct male cells in the brain of women. This also means
            these other male cells will be found in a foetus when the woman gets pregnant.
            (This is called microchimerism.)
            Every male you absorb sperm from becomes a living part of your life. Sperm is a living substance. Living
            cells. It enters your bloodstream and collects in your brain and spine.
            Stop experimenting with sex.
            When the sperm enters a woman it swims until it hits a wall and then seeps into your flesh.
            If it's in your mouth, (abomination) it can get into your nasal areas, behind your eyes and even your inner
            ear. It then enters your bloodstream and collects in your brain and spine. You can never get rid of it.
            It becomes a part of you forever. These are the true consequences of sexual intercourse.
            Original research is from University of Seattle and Fred Hutchinson cancer research center.
            They accidentally found this when they were researching to find out why pregnant women carrying boys get men
            neurological diseases.
            This is real and not a joke.!!!
            Stop having sex if you are not married.
            And stop having sex with other than your husband, for the married.
            The consequences of doing this is devastating.(Bastards)!!
            No wonder the world is the way it is!
            Say no to sex when not married.
            Say no to EXTRA-MARITAL affairs also.

        <h2 class="w3-white">Why Should You Stop Drinking Alcohol?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I Came Across This Thread On Twitter, and i thought it's worth Sharing....
            Do you wanna know the real reason alcohol is bad for you? In alchemy, alcohol is used to extract the essence
            of something. Same way hash is made from weed by leaving it in high concentrate alcohol (isopropyl alcohol).
            As you become more drunk,your soul starts to become irritated. As you become more waved you pollute your
            spiritual body (soul) so much it can't take it anymore. So it leaves your body. & When it does other souls
            enter & posses you. That's why strong alcohols are called SPIRIT!
            There's all kinds of other spirits, theres ghouls, spirits, demons... Even djinn (Gin). As if to say certain
            types of alcohol are named over which type of spirits take over you.
            The medical explanation for being so drunk you can't remember anything is that its affected the part of your
            brain that stores new memory & stops it from doing so. The spiritual explanation is that your soul literally
            wasn't there for you to remember anything. You were possessed.
            When you see people acting too different when they've fallen off. In essence it's not them at all. Dw
            though. Your soul doesn't go too far. It just stays a safe distance from your body until it's habitable
            again. & More time the spirits that posses you are very low frequency.
            Now all those times of people doing a madness while drunk & claiming they don't know how they ended up in
            said situation makes sense ey? The moral of the story is put the liquor down!
            For the record. Alcohol comes from the Arabic word al-kuhl which means "body eating spirit". Apparently the
            English word "ghoul" comes from it too. Sometimes it's "al-ghawl".

        <h2 class="w3-white">Useful Tips For Married Ladies</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>1.The wife that wins all arguments with her husband is not wise. The home is not a law court.
            <br> 2. The wife that uses sex as a weapon in their home is dangerous, it’s wrong going to bed in jeans
            shorts and trousers, A real woman takes shower before and after bed
            <br> 3. The wife that uses the modern trends and laws of “women’s rights” to insult or ridicule her husband
            simply makes a fool of herself and the force she uses will fight her back with depression and frustrations
            <br> 4. A woman that makes her home devoid of peace through bickering, nagging and quarrels needs help. A
            man should be eager to run away from office or any working place to be at home, for that should be the
            safest and coolest place on earth for him. Even the Bible allows men to stay in the wilderness than live
            with a nagging wife.
            <br> 5. Modern-day equality in marriage does not mean competition. It simply means partnership. Taking
            advantage of such equality to turn around and become the de facto head of the home and oppress the man is
            tantamount to playing with fire. If you destroy your home, soon you will be the boss of an empty home.
            <br> 6. A wise wife makes the man feel so good that he assumes that he is the head. Once he gets that
            feeling, the woman gently wields her power and the head actually turns to wherever the neck wants without a
            protest. Men are easy to control where they’re respected without any force
            <br> 7. A wife that does not pull herself away from friends’ influence and advice or even from the control
            of her mother and father will have herself to blame.
            <br> 8. When a man is looking for a wife, he bypasses women of different shapes and sizes to choose a wife.
            But soon after childbirth, many women hide under the excuse of childbirth to let go of themselves. Many stop
            bothering about their looks, shape, dressing, etc. Within 5 years of marriage, people start wondering if the
            wife is the man’s aunt, even though she is 3 to 4 years younger. Her defense is that if he truly loves her,
            he should love her the way she is. But when looking for a wife, he saw people like the present YOU and
            ignored them and settled for the former YOU. Today, you go to bed smelling of onions and dania. You go to
            bed wearing grandmothers’ clothes. Why are you playing with your marriage? Love is not about looks – we
            know. But looks enhance love and marriage. There is a difference between someone disfiguring herself and the
            person being disfigured by an accident. Please don’t be complacent. As hard as it may be, work on looking
            like you were when he first saw you and began the chase.
            <br> 9. If every night you are tired, sleepy, sore, down with headache or fever, “not in the mood,” you are
            a joker, a serious comedian! YOU don’t deserve to be someone wife period.
            <br> 10. If your children suddenly become more important to you than your husband, you need prayers and
            deliverance.
            <br> 11. If you assume that as the woman, only you need to be pampered and fussed over while the man is a
            stone that has no emotions, you need to be pitied.men have feelings and emotions too mind your words and
            actions
            <br> 12. A woman that has the mind of a wife does not excite her husband. Wives are usually complacent and
            always believe I own him so I don’t care , then be always a girlfriend to your hubby , A wife must strive to
            have the mind of a girlfriend. Be a girlfriend to your husband never try to win all arguments, a wife who is
            a friend to her husband never call him useless man”, a girl friend
            <br> like wife is careful about her looks and dressing, a girl friend like wife always smiles and laughs
            with her husband, she never sends insults messages to her husbands or calls him just to ruin his day with
            insults and a abusive words etc. Are you your husband’s girlfriend in word and in deed?
            <br> 13. First but I choose to write it last for everyone to remember .....When you rely on your beauty,
            cookings, character, connections and bedroom performance alone to keep your man and your home intact without
            putting God First you’ve missed it all .Without GOD, it cannot work it cannot be GOOD. Put God first in your
            home. Always pray for your husband.

        <h2 class="w3-white">INTEGRITY TEST!</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>(1) If you usually put more sugar in your tea when in a hotel than you do at home, You're likely to be
            corrupt!
            <br> (2) If you use more tissue in a public washroom than you do at home, you are a potential thief if given
            opportunity.
            <br> (3) If you serve yourself more food than you can finish, not minding whether it will go round, just
            because someone else is footing the bill, you're greedy. And you will steal if opportunity presents itself.
            <br> (4) If you usually jump queues, you have the potential for abusing office if given a powerful position.
            <br> (5) If you are more concerned about knowing someone's surname rather than first name, you're likely to
            be a tribal bigot. It’s even worse when someone tells you their name & then you ask, "which tribe is that?"
            It means you are tribalistic.
            <br> (6) If you usually overtake while in traffic jam or have no regard for traffic lights, then you would
            easily embezzle public funds if you're given a position at a public office since you hate regulation .
            <br> (7) If you channel waste or dirty water from your compound to a neighbour's compound rather than
            managing it, you're ill-mannered. You don't love your neighbour as yourself.
            <br> ( If you look at this post and wonder whether it was really necessary to talk about these issues;
            then you are very dishonest and you would easily cover up ills in the society for your own benefit.)
            <br> LET US TRY TO BE PEOPLE OF CHARACTER WHEREVER WE FIND OURSELVES.

        <h2 class="w3-white">COMMON MISTAKES WOMEN MAKE AFTER DISCOVERING AN AFFAIR</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>When you have just discovered that your man is cheating on you...please do NOT do the following:- <br>
            1.
            Demanding to know about the other woman: The truth may hurt you. Can you handle the truth?
            <br> 2.
            Insulting the other woman: You are giving her power she does'nt deserve. Especially if you insult her to
            your husband e.g. how is your slut doing?
            <br> 3.
            Forcing him to choose, thinking he will choose you: There is no competition here-you will lose this one! She
            is new and they are in the honeymoon phase. You, on the other hand, are an old habit.
            <br> 4.
            Calling him excessively to check on him like a prisoner: He may start to avoid your calls even if he is not
            doing anything bad just to protect his freedom.
            <br> 5.
            Beating the other woman up: You are creating sympathy for her. Now she looks like your victim to him. With
            this one you are still giving her power.
            <br> 6.
            Threatening to leave just to scare him: You are giving him ideas. You make the grass seem greener on the
            other side.
            <br> 7.
            Crying: He won't feel sympathy for you - he will feel burdened by the tears.
            <br> 8.
            Snooping: Don't hurt yourself unnecessarily. You will find what you are looking for. Don't break into his
            e-mails. Don't scroll his cellphone and don't go through his messages.
            <br> 9.
            Being in denial even though the signs are there: Do something about your knowledge or you will make yourself
            sick. Some diseases are stress-related. Deal with your issues; don't bottle them up.
            <br> 10.
            Telling his mother: For crying out loud! This is his mother!
            <br> 11.
            Committing suicide: Seriously, once you're gone, you're gone!
            <br> Do the following; Put the phone down.
            It is wise to leave his phone alone. When you are hurting, deal with your disappointment instead of going
            through his phone only to find more truths that will hurt you.
            When his phone rings, leave the room. Even if it's ringing unattended to, leave it alone. Don't answer his
            phone. Learn to be strong and ignore it.
            Don't steal numbers of women from his phone and start embarrassing yourself. These women will know that you
            are insecure and will press-on with the affair.
            Under no circumstances should you call the other woman. If you call her you will achieve nothing except to
            acknowledge her. She doesn't exist, treat her like that. Entomb her in the dust of her own nothingness.
            <br> Dont call your man twenty times a day. It is annoying, he already knows he violated your trust. Don't
            rub it in his face that you don't trust him. Remember if you want to win this one: create your own rules! Go
            left when he thinks you will go right!
            Pray and read the Bible more and God will fight this battle for you

        <h2 class="w3-white">SOME FACTS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT LIFE</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Nobody can become rich by his salary alone. Use it to invest!
            <br> And whoever is too afraid to invest, will die poor.
            <br> The poor work to make money.
            <br> The rich make their money work ..
            <br> After finding work, you should find work for your money.
            <br> Your two combined remunerations will make your wealth.
            <br> Being too afraid to invest is like deciding not to sow because of a bad season that has caused huge
            losses.
            <br> Be leaders and not followers.
            <br> Decide to be rich and not just rely on a likely job.
            <br> Great men are not born in greatness, they grow up.
            <br> If you do not run after what you want, you'll never get it.
            <br> If you do not ask, the answer will always be no.
            <br> If you do not take a step forward, you always stay in one place.
            <br> To succeed in your life, you must learn to never back down from obstacles and achieve the goal you have
            set for yourself.
            <br> A pessimist sees the difficulty in each opportunity, an optimist sees the opportunity in each
            difficulty.
            <br> You must remain motivated, believe in yourself, in your projects, go beyond, and be positive.
            <br> Life is fraught with difficulties that everyone must learn to overcome with determination.
            <br> And never forget that the biggest failure is never trying at all.
            <br> #LIFE IS SUPER!!!
